//! This module contains documentation thats is too long for one line and moreover,
//! it spans over mulitple lines such that we can test our rewrapping algorithm. Smart,
//! isn't it? Lorem ipsum and some more blanket text without any meaning
//!
//! But lets also see what happens if there are two consecutive newlines in one connected
//! documentation span.

/// This is short.
